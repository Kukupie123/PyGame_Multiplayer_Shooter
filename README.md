# Aqua Mayhem Multiplayer

2D Top down Multiplayer game using PyGame And bare bone python's socket for the backend. Fairly easy, the hard part was
the multiplayer and making everything sync up perfectly with each client. It's not perfect, no where close To being
perfect But I am fairly okay with the result so decided to stop after few tweaks.

Enemy position, Enemy Spawn, are 100% server sided meaning server is responsible for spawning and moving enemies. The
player/ Clients can only request the data of the enemy
