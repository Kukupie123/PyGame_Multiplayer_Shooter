# Aqua Mayhem Multiplayer
2D Top down Multiplayer game using PyGame
And bare bone python's socket for the backend.
Fairly easy, the hard part was the multiplayer and making everything sync up perfectly with each client.
It's not perfect, no where close To being perfect
But I am fairly okay with the result so decided to stop after few tweaks
